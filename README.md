This repository serves as a comprehensive, step-by-step guide to building, configuring, and operating your **LeRobot SO-ARM101 Robotic Arm**. Our mission is to demystify robotics and AI by providing a hands-on learning experience, culminating in the implementation of advanced control techniques like **Diffusion Policy**, **ACT** and so on.

Whether you're a beginner curious about robotics or an enthusiast eager to dive into imitation learning, this guide is designed to help you bring your SO-ARM101 to life and equip it with intelligent control.

If you don't yet have a LeRobot SO-ARM101, you have a few options to get started:

  * **Build Your Own:** Explore the official GitHub repository for the SO-ARM100 (the core design for the 101) to find detailed build instructions and component lists:
    [TheRobotStudio/SO-ARM100](https://github.com/TheRobotStudio/SO-ARM100)
  * **Purchase a Kit:** You can often find ready-to-assemble kits or pre-built arms on platforms like Amazon or Taobao for less than Â£200.

## Setting Up Your Robotic Arm

Once you have your SO-ARM101 kit and components ready, let's dive into the exciting world of robotic arm control\!

### 1\. Pre-configuring Servo IDs and Parameters

Properly setting up your servo motors is a crucial first step for stable and reliable arm operation.

  * **Download the Servo Configuration Tool:**
    You'll need the `FD1.9.8.5` servo debugging tool to configure your servo IDs and parameters.
    [Download FD1.9.8.5 (250425).zip](https://gitee.com/ftservo/fddebug/blob/master/FD1.9.8.5\(250425\).zip)
