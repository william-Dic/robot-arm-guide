### 1.2 Setting Up Your Robotic Arm

Once you have your SO-ARM101 kit and components ready, let's dive into the exciting world of robotic arm control! Properly setting up your servo motors is a crucial first step for stable and reliable arm operation. You can also **Follow the Configuration Tutorial**: [LeRobot SO-ARM101 Robotic Arm - Assembly and Setup Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70GuJf2jbYk)

* **Download the Servo Configuration Tool:** You'll need the `FD1.9.8.5` servo debugging tool [Download FD1.9.8.5 (250425).zip](https://gitee.com/ftservo/fddebug/blob/master/FD1.9.8.5\(250425\).zip) to configure your servo IDs and parameters.
  <p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c2102d50-6846-43e8-a11e-6e051fc7278d" width="400">
</p>

* **Setting Up Your Leader&Follower Arm Servos** To ensure your Leader Arm operates correctly, you'll need to match each servo to its specific joint and configure its settings. Different gear ratios mean different torque, so **each servo needs a unique ID corresponding to the joint it will control**.
  <p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c9a3a68-dac4-4652-813a-a1c6960e2581" width="400px" height="250px" style="display: inline-block; margin: 0 10px;">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/93bae1dc-88f3-493a-81da-a8cc86f253dd" width="400px" height="250px" style="display: inline-block; margin: 0 10px;">
  </p>

    1.  **Label Your Servos:** Before you begin, I highly recommend **labeling your servos with their intended joint ID (e.g., 1, 2, 3, etc.) on paper**. This will prevent confusion and ensure you connect the right servo to the right place.
    2.  **Configure Servo IDs and Amax:** Once your servos are labeled, you'll use the **Servo Configuration Tool** to set their IDs and Amax values.
        Using the Servo Configuration Tool, you'll need to make two key changes for each servo:
        1.  **Set the Servo ID:** Assign the **corresponding joint ID** that you determined in the labeling step. This ensures the arm's control system can properly communicate with each servo.
        2.  **Adjust Amax to 254:** Always change the **Amax value to 254**. This setting is crucial for optimal performance of your Leader Arm.
        By following these steps, you'll successfully prepare your servos for integration into the Leader Arm, ensuring smooth and accurate movement.

### 1.3 Assembling and Wiring Your Robotic Arm

Now that all your servos are configured, it's time to assemble your robot arm! Please follow the CAD animation and real demonstration videos provided below. **Pay close attention as the CAD for the Leader and Follower arms are different.**

* **Assembly CAD Animation:** [LeRobot SO-ARM101 Robotic Arm Assembly CAD Animation](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV18gG1z4EZu/?spm_id_from=333.337.search-card.all.click&vd_source=3a694e50ce8cc42bb59f208d9a0785e9)
* **Assembly Real Demonstration:**

    * **Follower Arm Assembly:** [LeRobot SO-ARM101 Follower Arm Assembly](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70GuJf2jbYk&t=24m40s)
* **Wiring Demonstration:** [LeRobot SO-ARM101 Wiring Demenstration](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70GuJf2jbYk&t=54m07s)

### 1.4 Joint Midpoint and Limit Settings

To prevent the servo and for calibration purpose we need to set joint midpoint and Limit Settings for each servo, when you connect all the servos correctly, open your FD1.9.8.5 you should be able to see a page like below. You have 6 servos listed in the left column.
  <p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bba66224-2204-4acb-9653-be5c5dd85ee0" width="400px" height="250px" style="display: inline-block; margin: 0 10px;">
  </p>

Then move each joint to maximum/minimum position and then according to the value shown in *cureent position* change your limits.
For Joints 1-5: Reserve a margin of 20 - 30 from the actual reachable encoder value (address56).
For Joint 6: Reserve a margin of 10 - 20 from the actual reachable encoder value.
You can find more detailed handon demo in [LeRobot SO-ARM101 Joint Midpoint and Limit Settings](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70GuJf2jbYk)
