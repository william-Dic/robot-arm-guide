</p>

If you don't yet have a LeRobot SO-ARM101, you have a few options to get started:

  * **Build Your Own:** Explore the official GitHub repository for the SO-ARM100 (the core design for the 101) to find detailed build instructions and component lists:
    [TheRobotStudio/SO-ARM100](https://github.com/TheRobotStudio/SO-ARM100)
  * **Purchase a Kit:** You can often find ready-to-assemble kits or pre-built arms on platforms like Amazon or Taobao for less than £200.

## Setting Up Your Robotic Arm

Once you have your SO-ARM101 kit and components ready, let's dive into the exciting world of robotic arm control\!

### 1\. Pre-configuring Servo IDs and Parameters

Properly setting up your servo motors is a crucial first step for stable and reliable arm operation.

  * **Download the Servo Configuration Tool:**
    You'll need the `FD1.9.8.5` servo debugging tool to configure your servo IDs and parameters.
    [Download FD1.9.8.5 (250425).zip](https://gitee.com/ftservo/fddebug/blob/master/FD1.9.8.5\(250425\).zip)
    You Should be able to see a page like below:

## What's Next in this Guide?

This guide will progressively lead you through:

  * **Hardware Assembly & Wiring:** Detailed instructions for putting your SO-ARM101 together.
  * **Basic Control & Calibration:** Getting your arm to move with simple commands.
  * **Software Environment Setup:** Preparing your computer for advanced robotics development (Python, relevant libraries).
  * **Introduction to Diffusion Policy:** Understanding the theory behind this powerful imitation learning technique.
  * **Implementing Diffusion Policy:** Practical steps to collect data, train models, and deploy Diffusion Policy on your SO-ARM101 for various tasks.
  * **Troubleshooting & Advanced Tips:** Common issues and how to resolve them.
