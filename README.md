### 1.2 Setting Up Your Robotic Arm

Once you have your SO-ARM101 kit and components ready, let's dive into the exciting world of robotic arm control! Properly setting up your servo motors is a crucial first step for stable and reliable arm operation. You can also **Follow the Configuration Tutorial**: [LeRobot SO-ARM101 Robotic Arm - Assembly and Setup Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70GuJf2jbYk)

* **Download the Servo Configuration Tool:** You'll need the `FD1.9.8.5` servo debugging tool to configure your servo IDs and parameters.
    * [Download FD1.9.8.5 (250425).zip](https://gitee.com/ftservo/fddebug/blob/master/FD1.9.8.5\(250425\).zip)
    * ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c2102d50-6846-43e8-a11e-6e051fc7278d)

* **Setting Up Your Leader Arm Servos** To ensure your Leader Arm operates correctly, you'll need to match each servo to its specific joint and configure its settings. Different gear ratios mean different torque, so **each servo needs a unique ID corresponding to the joint it will control**.
    * ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5493b828-6995-4775-a622-27921ef4bb6f)
    1.  **Label Your Servos:** Before you begin, I highly recommend **labeling your servos with their intended joint ID (e.g., 1, 2, 3, etc.) on paper**. This will prevent confusion and ensure you connect the right servo to the right place.
        * ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a524c519-1ece-4a69-9783-8c17f7e586a3)
    2.  **Configure Servo IDs and Amax:** Once your servos are labeled, you'll use the **Servo Configuration Tool** to set their IDs and Amax values.
        Using the Servo Configuration Tool, you'll need to make two key changes for each servo:
        1.  **Set the Servo ID:** Assign the **corresponding joint ID** that you determined in the labeling step. This ensures the arm's control system can properly communicate with each servo.
            ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/91f2daae-23c1-4954-bd1e-3b41897500fa)
        2.  **Adjust Amax to 254:** Always change the **Amax value to 254**. This setting is crucial for optimal performance of your Leader Arm.
            ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1615a84c-30e7-4901-a12d-645e6f4975b7)

        By following these steps, you'll successfully prepare your servos for integration into the Leader Arm, ensuring smooth and accurate movement.
