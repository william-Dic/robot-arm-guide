</p>

If you don't yet have a LeRobot SO-ARM101, you have a few options to get started:

- **Build it Yourself**
   - Source the components from the [Bill of Materials](#sourcing-parts).
   - 3D print the parts (or order the 3D printed parts), explained in [Printing the Parts](#printing-the-parts).
   - Follow our [Assembly Guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/lerobot/so101).
- **Buy a Kit**
   - Buy assembled arms or a parts kit from one of the vendors [here](#kits).
   - Optionally follow our [Assembly Guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/lerobot/so101).

### 1.2 Setting Up Your Robotic Arm

Once you have your SO-ARM101 kit and components ready, let's dive into the exciting world of robotic arm control!

1. Pre-configuring Servo IDs and Parameters

Properly setting up your servo motors is a crucial first step for stable and reliable arm operation.

* **Download the Servo Configuration Tool:**
    You'll need the `FD1.9.8.5` servo debugging tool to configure your servo IDs and parameters.
    [Download FD1.9.8.5 (250425).zip](https://gitee.com/ftservo/fddebug/blob/master/FD1.9.8.5\(250425\).zip)
    You should be able to see a page like below:
